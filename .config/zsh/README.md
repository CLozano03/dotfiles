    <h2>Mi zsh config</h2>

This is my Shell configuration. I use `Zsh` because it belongs to posix and is highly customizable.

#### Install 
For installing, just run this command and it will be ready for use:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CLozano03/dotfiles/main/.config/zsh/install.sh | sh && clear && source ~/.zshrc
```
